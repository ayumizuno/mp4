It is no secret that animated films cost hundreds of millions more today than in the Golden age of animated films that included movies such as *Pinocchio* which had a budget of \$2.6 million. The increase in unsurprising: times have changed, teams are bigger, CGI is more expensive than pencils and paint. 

According to industry analyst [James Cole](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-average-budget-of-an-animated-movie), on average most animated films today can range anywhere from \$2 million to \$250 million. Some of the money goes to the writers, some to storyboard artists, some to background artists, layout artists, animators, directors and most of the budget goes to the stars. Surprisingly, more and more dollars are allocated for server costs as well. According to [*The Slate*](http://www.slate.com/blogs/quora/2013/06/20/pixar_and_monsters_university_why_do_animated_movies_cost_so_much.html), "for a movie of the size of *Toy Story*, you need a server farm with 5,000 or more machines running all year. That is a lot of computing power, support personnel and energy." 

Behind the glamorous visual effects and splendid plots, however, the profit might no longer justify the cost, at least for Disney. To investigate the relationship between profit and cost, we pulled data on Disney animated films from the IMDB database, from *Three Little Pigs* in 1933 to *The Emoji Movie* in 2017, the latest record. The data confirms our gut feeling that the ever-rising budget of animated films might reflect Hollywood’s blockbuster gambling addiction more than its profitability. 

```{r}
datatable(disney_clean, options = list(pageLength = 10))
```

Big-budget films don’t always generate good box office numbers. In fact, the scatter plot below shows that the relationship can be slightly negative. Though there is a great number of high budget films in 2000s, ,ore box office bombs were produced then than in any other era. *Treasure Planet* (2006) cost around $100 million more than it made -  approximately the same as the combined annual salaries for the [two highest-paid Hollywood actors in 2016](https://hubpages.com/money/10-Great-Things-to-Buy-for-100-Million-Serious-Money), Angelina Jolie and Leonardo DiCaprio.


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
p<-ggplot(disney_clean,aes(x =budget, y = profit)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(decade)),position='dodge')+
  scale_color_discrete(labels = c('1930', '1940', '1950', '1960', '1970', '1980', '1990', '2000', '2010'))+

```


The average profit plot shows a downward trend since the 1960s, the decade filled with successful Disney animated films such as *The Jungle Book* and *One Hundred and One Dalmatians*. The nonparallel relationship between budget and profit persists even taking into account the increase number ofanimation production numbers. Although more films are produced, the sum of profit suffers a dip in the 2000s and fails to show a steep rise in 2010s. At the same time, there is a robust upward trend in budget despite the weak profit.


```{r, echo=FALSE}

disney_mean <- disney_clean %>%
  select(decade, title, profit, budget) %>%
  group_by(decade) %>%
  summarize(Profit = mean(profit),
            Budget = mean(budget)) %>%
  gather(key = 'type', value = 'value',Profit,Budget )
p2<-ggplot(disney_mean,aes(x=factor(decade), y = value, fill = type)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position= "dodge")+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette= 'Set1')+

            Budget = sum(budget)) %>%

The 20 most profitable Disney animated films chart confirms this negative trend in budget and profit. At the first glance, you are tricked to think animated movies are more successful in recent decades. Movies produced in the 2000s and 2010s dominate the chart, with *Finding Nemo* and *Finding Dory* taking the top two spots at a strong $286 million each (which can buy you [the most expensive house in the US](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/karenhua/2017/01/18/inside-a-250-million-mansion-the-most-expensive-home-for-sale-in-the-u-s/&refURL=https://www.google.com/&referrer=https://www.google.com/), and still leave you a couple million for furniture!). 


```{r}

  arrange(desc(profit)) %>%

But when you take into account the budget, older films seem to be winning the race. Movies on this chart that cost the most also comes from the 2010s: *Finding Dory*, *Inside Out*, *Zootopia*, *Frozen*, and *Moana*. Although all movies on the chart before the 1970s had low budgets, they were extremely successful.  


Take, for example, *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs* (1937), the most profitable Disney animated film before the 1990s. This [first full-length animated film and the first Walt Disney Animation Studios film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_White_and_the_Seven_Dwarfs_(1937_film)). Classics has become historical milestones, cultural icons, and a source of nostalgia. Classics like this one continue to gain an upper hand in competition with newer films: *Snow White*, with the lowest budget in the top 10, made greater profit than *Inside Out*.

The danger of pouring money into a buzzing genre eyeing grand slams like *Frozen* regardless of the general box-office trend is obvious: it’s not that there isn’t demand; it’s just there’s an awful lot of supply. With budgets running high and box-office profits going downhill, why are producers still plunging into this dangerous market?

Even though animated films are making less in recent years, they are still the most profitable genre, averaging a 36% return over the past decade, according to [*The Seattle Times*](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/animated-movies-hit-high-point-so-do-studios-costs-potential-rewards/). A high budget animated film is risky, but spending more to produce a quality piece may result in favorable earnings such as *Finding Dory* did.

Additionally, animated films are taking over the film market. [*The Numbers*](https://www.the-numbers.com/market/production-method/Digital-Animation) shows that digital animation has risen from a 2% market share in 1995 to ten-fold increase of 20% in 2016. 

The charm of animated films also lie outside our data. According to *The Seattle Times*, financiers have been emboldened by the potential for fat returns outside box office. "*Frozen*, with its massive \$1.3 billion in ticket sales, was dwarfed by an estimated \$6 billion in ancillary product revenue. Producers are almost thinking more about that side of the business and certainly earlier than ever before,” Piper Jaffray analyst Stan Meyer said, “It’s gone from toys to food and clothes and a bunch of other categories.”

Even though Disney has abandoned small production animated films, small studios of today are still making low budget animated films for a few million. [*The Missing Lynx*](https://www.revolvy.com/main/index.php?s=The%20Missing%20Lynx&item_type=topic), budgeted at \$6.5 million and produced by Spanish studios Kandor Graphics and YaYa! Films, is an example. According to [Cartoon Brew](http://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/new-wave-european-animated-features-small-budgets-big-freedom-149162.html), the computer-animated *Cinderella the Cat* has a minuscule budget of €1.3 million. In the film, Italian studio MAD Entertainment manages to create an intense, dark sci-fi adventure based on the classic fairytale.

How does a filmmaker deal with a budget at 1% of contemporary Disney productions? “We try to build a story that we can handle with the budget we have,” *Cinderella the Cat* director Cappiello told Cartoon Brew.

“We make a beautiful house,” producer Stella added. “We don’t make a skyscraper that will fall apart and that doesn’t have a soul.”
